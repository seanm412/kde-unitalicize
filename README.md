# kde-unitalicize
Unitalicize desktop symlink icons on Plasma 5

Desktop icons of symlinks (for example, shortcuts for applications) have italic titles on Plasma 5. This shell script removes the line of code responsible, creating a uniform desktop look even more similar to Windows.

This script may need to be run as root to function.
